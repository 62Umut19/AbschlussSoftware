# AbschlussSoftware

I'm programming a school software for my school as a degree project.

In this software, students or parents can make an appointment with a teacher online. In addition, every student can report sickness online and upload a medical certificate to the school server. The book distribution system will then be switched from analog to digital. And last but not least, the attendances are entered in the software and no longer in the class book.

I'm programming the backend with Node.js, and the frontend with Vue.js (Vuetify). I'm also using MySql.
